                <p>Four score and seven years ago, I was not born. But a new ruler formed then — 1936 began with the
                    crowning of
                    King Edward VIII. I'm Zidane Karim, and I believe I have what it takes to be Senior Caucus
                    co-president.
                    I want
                    to ease life for everyone while making sure that the caucus stays connected to the student body. My
                    personal
                    goals are making sure everyone's voice is heard, whether that ranges from the morning announcements,
                    to
                    important decisions involving our student lives, or even just to event themes. From my experience
                    leading a
                    club since freshman year, creating websites to better the student body, and my silver prestige in
                    Hypixel's
                    Bedwars, I believe I've built up the skills over the years to successfully manage our final year in
                    our
                    high
                    school lives.

                <p>Hello everyone! I am currently running down the up escalator, and I'm running for Stuyvesant Student
                    Union
                    Senior Caucus Co-President. My fellow Americans. I know what you may be thinking. Last year, we
                    tried to
                    run
                    for Junior Caucus, and we did attend the interest meeting. In case you didn't know, we did not win.
                    But
                    this
                    year, that may or may not change. You want my qualifications? Sure thing! I lead a top 10 club in
                    the
                    school
                    ever since freshman year. I'm also in robotics. And I've been involved in the SU already through the
                    IT
                    departments of caucus and SU. Most importantly, I go to school. Sent from my computer, Anthony Chen
